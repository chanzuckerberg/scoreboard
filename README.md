# Scoreboard

## This is a work in progress

Scoreboard is a web application to view and submit ML algorithms solutions to challenges. 

See an example deployment here: http://hpa.scoreboard.czi.technology/challenge/1

To run it locally, clone this repo then type

    npm install
    
    npm run build # builds javascript bundle
    node server
    # go to http://127.0.0.1:9001/
    

You may also need to setup a local postgres db called scoreboard, for instructions checkout this [link](https://www.codementor.io/@engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb)
