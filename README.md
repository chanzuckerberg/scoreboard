# Scoreboard

## Update 2022: Archived

The effort of this repo has been superseded by a community effort to benchmark the hardest challenges in Single Cell Analysis called [Open Problems](https://openproblems.bio/). The Github can be found [here](https://github.com/openproblems-bio/openproblems).

## ~~This is a work in progress~~

Scoreboard is a web application to view and submit ML algorithms solutions to challenges.

See an example deployment here: http://hpa.scoreboard.czi.technology/challenge/1

To run it locally, clone this repo then type

    npm install

    npm run build # builds javascript bundle
    node server
    # go to http://127.0.0.1:9001/
